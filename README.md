# IOTRONICS-PARC
Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the PARC Robotics Competition! This repository contains the codebase and resources for our team's participation in the prestigious PARC Robotics Challenge.
# Competition Overview:
The PARC Robotics Competition is an annual event that brings together talented roboticists and enthusiasts from around the world to showcase their innovative solutions in the field of autonomous robotics. In this year's edition, the competition focuses on a combined task of navigation and weed detection in an agricultural environment.

# Our Team:
We are a passionate and dedicated team of robotics enthusiasts from [Your Institution/Organization]. Our team members possess a diverse set of skills, including robotics, computer vision, path planning, and machine learning. Together, we aim to tackle the challenges presented by the competition and demonstrate cutting-edge robotics solutions.

# Competition Tasks:
During the competition's physical robot phase, our robot's primary objective is to navigate through a designated field while simultaneously identifying and tagging weeds. The robot must autonomously make real-time decisions and accurately publish weed locations at the end of the task. The competition poses exciting challenges that require us to develop robust and efficient algorithms.

# Repository Structure:

src/: This directory contains the source code for our robot's navigation and weed detection algorithms. We have implemented the core functionalities using [python, ROS, C++, & MATLAB].
data/: We store sensor data and ROS bag files provided by the competition organizers in this directory. These data files are crucial for simulation and testing purposes.
docs/: Here, you can find the documentation and user guides for our codebase. We provide detailed explanations of our approach and code structure for transparency and ease of collaboration.
results/: This directory stores the evaluation results and performance metrics obtained during our testing and competition runs.
resources/: We keep various resources, such as research papers, relevant articles, and competition guidelines, in this directory for quick reference.
How to Contribute:
We believe in the power of collaboration, and we welcome contributions from the open-source community. If you are interested in joining our team or contributing to our codebase, feel free to reach out to us through [contact email or other communication channels].

# Acknowledgements:
We would like to express our gratitude to the PARC Robotics Challenge organizers for providing this incredible platform to showcase our skills and innovations. Additionally, we thank the community for their continuous support and encouragement.

Let's work together to push the boundaries of robotics and make a significant impact in the field of agriculture!
